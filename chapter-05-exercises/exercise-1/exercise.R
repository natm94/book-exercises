# Exercise 1: practice with basic R syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

hometown <- "Astoria, Oregon"


# Assign your name to the variable `my_name`

my_name <- "Natalia"


# Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my_height`

my_height <- 5 * 12 + 9

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have

puppies <- 1000000


# Create a variable `puppy_price`, which is how much you think a puppy costs

puppy_price <- 400


# Create a variable `total_cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

total_cost <- puppy_price * puppies


# Create a boolean variable `too_expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater 
# than $1,000

budget <- 1000
too_expensive <- budget > 1000


# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can 
# afford for $1,000

max_puppies <- floor(budget / puppy_price)
